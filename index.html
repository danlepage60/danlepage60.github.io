						<!-- About Me -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a hardworking, motivated and creative bilingual professional, fluent in both English and French and am excited to embark on the next chapter of my career as a Software Developer. Throughout the different seasons in my career, a common thread has always been an intrinsic motivation to create and build different interconnected parts and how they come together into a unique culinary experience, a completed project, or a user friendly application. From Kitchens around the country as a Culinary Chef, to large construction sites and skyscrapers as a Quality Control Superintendent and Building Operator and now working at the comfort of my computer, this passion for creativity and curiosity remains. I equate my success to my ability to think outside of the box, my resourcefulness to seamlessly adapt to ever changing work environments, and my knack for being able to get along with different personality types .. even my mother in law. </p>
								<p>I have lived in Montreal, BC and now my wife and I are happy to call the mountains of Alberta home. When I’m not taking on the next challenge in my career, you can usually find me outdoors, hanging out with our Mini Aussie Shepherd or getting a head start on my “honey to do list” at home. </p>
